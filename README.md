# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
As many people in Pewlett Hackard reach retirement age, a manager at the company wanted to prepare for the "silver tsunami" and asked for a few queries or tables that would display information on future retirees and the possibility of creating a mentorship program. 

## Results

* If we count the rows from retirement_titles, we get a value of 133,776, but if we count the rows from unique_titles, we get a row count of 72,458. A total of 61,318 positions have been switched, and a large number of those positions may be vacant at the moment. 

### Retirement_titles Table

* Furthermore, when we look at unique_titles, we can see that most of those who switched are currently in senior positions. Due to the possibility of many retirees, the company will need to fill vacant spots and future empty senior positions.

* Based on the retiring_titles, we can count 50,842 employees who are currently in senior-related positions. About 70% of all  people at retirement age fall into this category.

* Finally, based on retiring_titles, there is a total of 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. However, Some of the employees there are still lower level employees and are not fit to become mentors.

## Summary

1. While these aren't necessarily the exact numbers, we can expect nearly 72,458 employees to retire soon. Due to employees switching or getting promoted, some of those positions may still be open and need to be filled, as shown in my results. However, senior and leadership posts are more important than lower-level ones, thus in the case of a "silver tsunami," 54,445 upper-level positions will need to be filled.

2. Out of the 1549 employees that were retirement-ready, only 1,175 are qualified to mentor the next generation. The 1,175 employees are in senior/leader level positions, and only those with lots of experience are qualified to be mentors.
